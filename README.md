This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to CSS's `calc()` function.  The issue occurs when attempting to combine percentage values and viewport units (like `vw` or `vh`) within a single `calc()` expression. The expected layout does not render correctly, potentially leading to unexpected visual results. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a working solution using alternative approaches.  This is a subtle edge-case that may not be immediately apparent to developers familiar with `calc()`, hence, its documentation here.
